# TimeKeeper
A simple app to keep track of time spent

For a friend who works on location. He needed an app to keep track of how much time he spent at each client, and afterwards be able to e-mail it to himself. Asked me to make it since there was nothing on the app store that was free and easy to use.

Made in Android studio 3.0
